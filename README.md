This is a test project

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/VitalikM95/React-App.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies for both server and client:
   ```sh
   cd client
   npm install
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

#### Development Mode

To start the project in development mode with server and client running simultaneously:

```sh
npm run start:dev
```

This will launch the server in development mode with watch mode enabled and start the client.

#### Production Mode

To build the project for production and start the server:

```sh
npm run build
npm run start:prod
```

This will build both server and client and then start the server in production mode.
